## extra packages needed

```bash
$ apm install project-manager linter linter-cpplint linter-gjslint linter-flake8
```
you need to install all the external linter tools yourself. (the atom packages are only the glue-logic)
please check the package descriptions for links / info to the installation-guides.

(show `projects.cson` with cmd-pallet (Ctrl+Shift+P) `ProjectManager Edit Projects`)
