Simon N uses screen & vim as his development environment.

My reason is that this provides me with a common environment across all the
machines that I develop on. I spend a significant amount of time ssh'ed into
remote machines, so I need something fast that doesn't consume a lot of
bandwidth.

Maybe one day I'll use one of those new fangled IDEs.
